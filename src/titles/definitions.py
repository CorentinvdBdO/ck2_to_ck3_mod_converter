    Change of paradigm:
    - In ck2 definitions refer to the county, baronies are not on the map
    - In ck3 definitions refer to the barony

    In a first step, we want to have each county have only their first barony on the map.

    Then we want to keep all the baronies in history and add them to the definitions, but only the first one is actually drawn.
